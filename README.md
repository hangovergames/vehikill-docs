The documentation is organized into logical sections that guide readers through different aspects of the project based on their needs and expertise level. Each document serves a specific purpose with minimal overlap, ensuring that readers can find relevant information efficiently while understanding how different systems work together.

The documentation follows professional standards for technical writing, using clear and concise language to explain complex concepts without requiring prior familiarity with the project. Cross-references between documents help readers understand relationships between different systems while avoiding unnecessary duplication of information. The writing style emphasizes accuracy and completeness while maintaining readability for developers with varying levels of experience.

## Game Overview and Core Features

Vehikill is a multiplayer vehicular combat game that operates entirely within web browsers, leveraging WebGL, WebRTC, and modern JavaScript technologies. The game combines real-time physics simulation with strategic combat mechanics, creating an environment where players must balance vehicle selection, tactical positioning, and resource management to achieve success.

The core gameplay revolves around six distinct vehicle types, each offering unique combinations of health, speed, and damage capabilities. Players engage in physics-based combat within enclosed arena environments, collecting loot and earning currency to unlock more powerful vehicles. The game features real-time voice communication through WebRTC, enabling social interaction and strategic coordination during matches.

The technical architecture demonstrates several innovations in web-based gaming, particularly in the areas of real-time physics simulation and multiplayer networking. The Web Worker-based physics system allows complex vehicle dynamics to run efficiently in background threads, while the WebRTC networking architecture enables low-latency peer-to-peer communication essential for responsive multiplayer combat.

## Documentation Structure and Navigation

The documentation is structured to support different reader needs and expertise levels. Newcomers to the project should begin with the Overview section to understand the game concept and key features, then explore Gameplay to learn about the core mechanics and player experience. The Overview provides essential context about the game's purpose, target audience, and design philosophy that informs all other aspects of the project.

Developers working with the codebase should start with the Architecture section to understand the technical structure, then review the Build documentation for development setup instructions. The Architecture section provides a comprehensive overview of the codebase organization, technology stack, and system design decisions that shape the entire project. This technical foundation is essential for understanding how different components interact and how to extend or modify the system.

Contributors to the project should review the Testing documentation for quality assurance procedures, the Tools section for available development utilities, and the Build documentation for the complete development workflow. These sections provide practical guidance for maintaining code quality and contributing effectively to the project's ongoing development.

## Technology Stack and Technical Approach

The Vehikill game leverages modern web technologies to deliver a high-performance multiplayer experience. The frontend utilizes React for UI management, A-Frame for WebVR support, Three.js for 3D graphics rendering, and Cannon.js for physics simulation. The backend is built on Node.js with Express, MongoDB for data persistence, and Redis for caching and real-time data management.

The networking layer combines WebSocket for server-client communication with WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections, enabling low-latency multiplayer gameplay. The physics system operates in Web Workers to prevent computational overhead from affecting rendering performance. The modular architecture supports extensibility and maintainability, with clear separation between game logic, rendering systems, and networking components.

The technical approach emphasizes performance optimization and cross-platform compatibility, ensuring that the game provides consistent experiences across different browsers and devices. The system includes adaptive quality adjustment, progressive loading, and intelligent resource management to accommodate varying hardware capabilities and network conditions.
