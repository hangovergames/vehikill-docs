# Networking Systems

## Networking Overview

The Vehikill game implements a sophisticated networking architecture that enables real-time multiplayer gameplay through a combination of WebSocket server-client communication and WebRTC peer-to-peer connections. The networking system provides low-latency data synchronization, reliable session management, and efficient bandwidth utilization to support smooth multiplayer experiences across various network conditions.

The networking architecture employs a hybrid approach that optimizes for both reliability and performance. WebSocket connections handle session establishment, player coordination, and room management, while WebRTC provides direct peer-to-peer communication for critical gameplay data. This design reduces server load while maintaining the responsiveness required for real-time vehicular combat.

## WebSocket Communication

The WebSocket system provides the foundation for server-client communication, handling session management, player coordination, and room-based multiplayer functionality. The WebSocket implementation operates on both secure and non-secure connections, automatically adapting to the deployment environment and browser security requirements.

The WebSocket server manages room-based multiplayer sessions where players can join ongoing games or create new sessions. The server handles player authentication, session state management, and coordination between connected clients. The room system supports dynamic player joining and leaving while maintaining game state consistency across all participants.

The WebSocket client implementation includes automatic reconnection logic and error handling to ensure reliable communication even under adverse network conditions. The client maintains connection state and automatically attempts to reconnect when connections are lost. The reconnection system includes exponential backoff to prevent server overload during network issues.

The WebSocket middleware manages the flow of data between the client application and the server, handling message serialization, routing, and error recovery. The middleware includes message validation and conflict resolution to ensure data integrity and prevent malicious or corrupted data from affecting gameplay.

## WebRTC Peer-to-Peer

The WebRTC system provides direct peer-to-peer communication for low-latency gameplay data exchange. The WebRTC implementation includes data channels for game state synchronization and audio channels for voice communication. The peer-to-peer approach reduces latency and server load while providing the responsiveness required for real-time vehicular combat.

The WebRTC connection establishment process includes signaling through the WebSocket server to coordinate peer discovery and connection setup. The signaling system exchanges connection information between peers, enabling direct communication without server intermediation. The connection process includes fallback mechanisms to handle various network configurations and firewall restrictions.

The WebRTC data channels provide reliable and unreliable communication options appropriate for different types of game data. The system creates three specific data channels: 'phys' for physics data with unreliable transmission, 'event' for game events with limited retransmission, and 'dispatch' for critical actions with reliable transmission. The channel selection optimizes for both data integrity and performance.

The WebRTC audio channels enable real-time voice communication between players with appropriate audio processing and quality controls. The audio system includes echo cancellation, noise suppression, and automatic gain control to ensure clear communication quality. The audio channels operate independently of data channels to prevent audio interference with gameplay data.

## Session Management

## Data Synchronization

The data synchronization system manages the real-time exchange of game state information between all connected players. The system includes efficient data serialization, compression, and prioritization to minimize bandwidth usage while maintaining game state consistency. The synchronization system supports both full state updates and incremental changes appropriate for different data types.

The vehicle state synchronization includes position, velocity, orientation, and damage information for all vehicles in the game. The system employs client prediction to provide responsive control while using server reconciliation to maintain accuracy. The vehicle synchronization includes interpolation and extrapolation techniques to handle network latency and packet loss.

The physics synchronization coordinates collision detection and physics simulation across all connected clients. The system includes deterministic physics calculations that ensure consistent behavior across different clients. The physics synchronization includes conflict resolution for collision events and damage calculations to maintain game balance and fairness.

The game logic synchronization includes player actions, game events, and progression updates that affect the overall game state. The system employs event-based synchronization for discrete actions and continuous synchronization for ongoing processes. The logic synchronization includes validation and anti-cheat measures to ensure fair gameplay.

## Network Optimization

The network optimization system ensures efficient bandwidth usage and minimal latency across various network conditions. The system includes data compression, delta encoding, and intelligent update frequency management to minimize network overhead while maintaining game responsiveness. The optimization includes adaptive quality adjustment based on connection quality and device capabilities.

Data compression includes efficient serialization formats and compression algorithms that reduce bandwidth requirements without sacrificing data integrity. The compression system supports different compression levels appropriate for various data types and network conditions. The system includes automatic compression selection based on connection quality and device performance.

Delta encoding transmits only changed data between network updates, significantly reducing bandwidth usage for frequently updated information such as vehicle positions and game state. The delta system includes efficient change detection and encoding algorithms that minimize processing overhead. The system includes fallback mechanisms for full state updates when delta encoding is not possible.

Update frequency management adjusts the rate of network updates based on data importance, network conditions, and performance requirements. Critical data such as player actions and collision events receive high update frequencies, while less critical data such as environmental effects receive lower frequencies. The frequency management includes automatic adjustment based on connection quality and server load.

## Latency Compensation

The latency compensation system addresses network latency to provide responsive gameplay despite varying network conditions. The system includes client prediction, server reconciliation, and interpolation techniques that minimize the impact of network delay on player experience. The compensation system maintains game accuracy while providing smooth and responsive controls.

Client prediction allows the local client to immediately respond to player input while waiting for server confirmation. The prediction system includes rollback mechanisms that correct client predictions when server state differs from predicted state. The prediction includes vehicle physics and collision detection to provide accurate local simulation.

Server reconciliation processes client predictions and corrects any discrepancies between predicted and actual game state. The reconciliation system includes conflict resolution for simultaneous actions and validation of client predictions. The system maintains game balance and prevents exploitation while minimizing correction frequency.

Interpolation provides smooth visual updates between network updates by blending between known game states. The interpolation system includes adaptive interpolation rates that adjust based on network conditions and update frequency.
